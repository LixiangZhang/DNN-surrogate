# Robust deep neural network surrogate models with uncertainty quantification via adversarial training

This repo contains the code used in our paper "Robust deep neural network surrogate models with uncertainty quantification via adversarial training". The data generator and CNN architecture are modified from https://github.com/Xihaier/DeepCNNs-surrogate-UQ.
Data is available at https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/mindlin-plate.
